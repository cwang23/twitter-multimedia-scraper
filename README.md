# twitter-multimedia-scraper
Scraper that scrapes dates, tweets, and images if provided with a CSV of twitter handles. 
This code was adapted from code provided by GitHub user freimanas (https://gist.github.com/freimanas/39f3ad9a5f0249c0dc64). 
"tweet_image_dumper.py" is primarily code written by GitHub user freimanas, with some minor adjustments by me. "pull_tweets.py" was written by me.
